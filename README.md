# Information Retrieval and Search

## 1. Introduction

Information retrieval is concerned with the _non-deterministic_ matching of a _query_ and _documents_ in large collections of _unstructured_ data (cf. data retrieval in a structured, deterministic context):

- Input: _Representation of text_.
- System: Formulation `q`, index generation `d` yielding a `Ranking(q, d)` of relevant documents.
- Output: _Retrieval model_.

### Text Preprocessing

1. Preparation of the document, e.g. removal of tags.
2. Lexical analysis: tokenisation.
3. Removal of stopwords (optional).
4. Stemming (optional), e.g. Porter algorithm.
5. Term weighting (optional).

### Text Representation and Similarity

Bag of Words (BoW) does not capture word order (and consequently similarity measures will be the same for some distinct sentences). Alternatives include character n-grams or word n-grams.

### Term Weighting

A weight is an importance indicator of a term regarding content:

- _Term frequency_: frequency of occurrence of the index term $i$ in document $j$. _Assumption_: High-frequency content signals main topics in the document!

  $$w_{ij} = \text{tf}_{ij}$$

**(Constant Rank-Frequency) Law of Zipf**: rank-frequency exhibit a log-linear relationship; highly frequent words are frequent in a lot of documents and might not necessarily be informative about a particular document.

- _Inverse document frequency_: $N$ = no. of documents in the reference collection, $n_i$ = no. of documents in the reference collection having index term $i$. Solves the previous issue!

  $$w_{ij} = \text{idf}_i = \log\Big( \frac{N}{n_i} \Big)$$

- _TfIdf_:

  $$w_{ij} = \text{tf-idf}_{ij} = \text{tf}_{ij} \times \text{idf}_i$$

- _Length normalisation_: $l$ = no. of distinct index terms in the document. Without normalisation, long documents would have a higher weight purely by virtue of containing more words!

  $$w_{ij} = \frac{\text{tf}_{ij}}{\max_{1 < k < l}(\text{tf}_{kj})}$$

- _Augmented normalised term frequency_: smoothing term $\alpha$ usually equal to $0.5$.

  $$w_{ij} = \alpha + (1 - \alpha) \frac{\text{tf}_{ij}}{\max_{1 < k < l}(\text{tf}_{kj})}$$

  $\alpha = 0$ is equivalent to standard length normalisation:

  ```python
  import numpy as np

  tf = np.array([2., 1., 2., 1., 0.])

  def augmented_normalised_tf(tf, alpha):
      return alpha + (1 - alpha) * (tf / max(tf))

  for alpha in [0., 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.]:
      print(augmented_normalised_tf(tf, alpha))
  [1., 0.5,   1., 0.5,   0.  ]
  [1., 0.625, 1., 0.625, 0.25]
  [1., 0.75,  1., 0.75,  0.5 ]
  [1., 0.875, 1., 0.875, 0.75]
  [1., 1.,    1., 1.,    1.  ]
  ```

### Ranked Retrieval Evaluation

More informative than accuracy:

$$\text{Precision (P)} = \frac{\textcolor{blue}{\text{retrieved}} \land \textcolor{red}{\text{relevant}}}{\textcolor{blue}{\text{retrieved}}}
\qquad \qquad
\text{Recall (R)} = \frac{\textcolor{blue}{\text{retrieved}} \land \textcolor{red}{\text{relevant}}}{\textcolor{red}{\text{relevant}}}$$

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

docs = np.array([1., 1., 1., 0., 1., 0., 1., 1., 0., 0., 1., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1.])

retrieved_and_relevant = docs.cumsum()
relevant = docs.nonzero()[0] + 1  # zero-indexing
precision = lambda retrieved: retrieved_and_relevant[retrieved-1] / retrieved
recall = lambda retrieved: retrieved_and_relevant[retrieved-1] / relevant.size

all = np.arange(docs.size) + 1
np.round(np.stack((all, precision(all), recall(all))), 2)
array([[ 1.  ,  2.  ,  3.  ,  4.  ,  5.  ,  6.  ,  7.  ,  8.  ,  9.  , 10.  , 11.  , 12.  , 13.  , 14.  , 15.  , 16.  , 17.  , 18.  , 19.  , 20.  , 21.  , 22.  , 23.  , 24.  ],
       [ 1.  ,  1.  ,  1.  ,  0.75,  0.8 ,  0.67,  0.71,  0.75,  0.67,  0.6 ,  0.64,  0.58,  0.62,  0.57,  0.53,  0.5 ,  0.47,  0.5 ,  0.47,  0.45,  0.43,  0.41,  0.39,  0.42],
       [ 0.1 ,  0.2 ,  0.3 ,  0.3 ,  0.4 ,  0.4 ,  0.5 ,  0.6 ,  0.6 ,  0.6 ,  0.7 ,  0.7 ,  0.8 ,  0.8 ,  0.8 ,  0.8 ,  0.8 ,  0.9 ,  0.9 ,  0.9 ,  0.9 ,  0.9 ,  0.9 ,  1.  ]])

pr_recall_levels = np.round(np.stack((relevant, recall(relevant), precision(relevant))), 2)
pr_recall_levels
array([[ 1.  ,  2.  ,  3.  ,  5.  ,  7.  ,  8.  , 11.  , 13.  , 18.  ,  24. ],
       [ 0.1 ,  0.2 ,  0.3 ,  0.4 ,  0.5 ,  0.6 ,  0.7 ,  0.8 ,  0.9 ,  1.  ],
       [ 1.  ,  1.  ,  1.  ,  0.8 ,  0.71,  0.75,  0.64,  0.62,  0.5 ,  0.42]])
plt.plot(pr_recall_levels[1], pr_recall_levels[2])
plt.show()
```

A single trade-off measure: $$F = \frac{(\beta^2 + 1) PR}{\beta^2 P + R}$$

- $\beta < 1$: emphasise precision
- $\beta = 1$: harmonic mean (F1 score)
- $\beta > 1$: emphasis recall

Breakeven point: point in the PR graph where $P = R$.

MAP, AUC-ROC, confusion matrix, etc.

## 2. Retrieval Models

Information retrieval (/ ranking / relevance) models are defined by:

- The **representation** of the document and query.
- The **ranking** function that uses these as arguments.

Model taxonomy:

- Simple (based on co-ocurrence / frequencies), _unsupervised_ (and can be applied to large datasets), focused on _topical relevance_ (necessary but not sufficient!) - therefore useful for an initial filtering of a large set of documents:
  - Set-theoretic (e.g. boolean): simple and efficient representation (as a set of index terms) but no ranking (only whether relevant or not).
  - Probabilistic (e.g. probabilistic language model): model the probability of relevance given a document and query.
  - Algebraic (e.g. vector space): simple and efficient representation (as vectors), ranking (similarity function between `d` and `q`).
- Link-based (e.g. PageRank)
- Neural network-based: learned vector representations of `q` and `d` through _supervision_ (need annotated data such as user profiles and behaviour to model intentional and motivational relevance).

A **retrieval model** $\langle D, Q, F, R(d_j, q_i) \rangle$:

- $D$ is the set of _representations_ of the _documents_ in the collection.
- $Q$ is the set of _representations_ of the _queries_.
- $F$ is a framework for modelling document and query _representations_, and their relationships.
- $R(d_j , q_i)$ is a _ranking function_ that takes a document and query representations $d_j \in D, q_i \in Q$ and returns a real number that expresses the potential relevance of $d_j$ to $q_i$ by which documents can be ordered.
- $K = k_1, \dots, k_t$ is the set of all index terms.
- $t$ is the number of index (_vocabulary_) terms in the collection.
- $w_{ij} \text{ or } w_{iq}$ is a weight associated with each index term $k_i$ of a document representation $d_j$ or query representation $q$:
  - $\mathbf{d_j} = [w_{1j}, w_{2j}, \dots, w_{tj}]$ is the term vector of $d_j$.
  - $\mathbf{q} = [w_{1q}, w_{2q}, \dots, w_{tq}]$ is the term vector of $q$.

### Boolean Models

The index term weight variables are all binary: $w_{ij}, w_{iq} \in \{0, 1\}$.

A query $q$ is a Boolean expression in _disjunctive normal form (DNF)_:

$$\text{Query: } k_1 \land \lnot k_4$$
$$\text{DNF: } (0, 0, 0, 1) \lor (0, 0, 1, 1) \lor (0, 1, 0, 1) \lor (0, 1, 1, 1)$$

| Advantages | Disadvantages                                                          |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Simplicity | Relative importance of index terms is ignored.                         |
|            | No ranking (only matching; may be that no document matches the query). |

### Extended Boolean Models

Hybrid model with properties of set theoretic and algebraic models: takes into account _partial fulfilment_ of the query and _sorts_ documents by relevance to obtain a ranking.

Note: disjunctive queries are good if far from the origin, conjunctive queries are good if close to $(1, 1)$.

### Bag of Words (BoW) Vector Space Models

Document and query are represented as term vectors with term weights $\geq 0$ in a $t$-dimensional space, where $t$ is the number of features (here terms) measured. Vector of concepts / topics with number of dimensions $k \ll$ number of index terms $t$.

A ranking of the documents is obtained with a distance / _similarity_ measure between document $d_j$ and query $q$: Manhattan distance, Euclidean distance, inner product similarity, cosine similarity (most popular), etc.

$$\cos(d_j, q) = \frac{d_j^T \cdot q}{\lVert d_j \rVert \lVert q \rVert} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^t{w_{ij} w_{iq}}}{\sum_{i=1}^t{w_{ij}^2} \, \sum_{i=1}^t{w_{iq}^2}}$$

TODO: disadvantage of BoW vector space models (below) and picture in this lecture with disadvantage mentioned in lecture 1.

### Probabilistic Retrieval Models

Probabilistically retrieval is a problem of estimating the probability of relevance given a query, document, collection, etc. and ranking the retrieved documents in decreasing order of this probability.

#### Generative Relevance Models

Consider the random variables $D$ = document, $Q$ = query, $R \in \{r, \bar{r}\}$ = relevance (relevant, not relevant).

$$
P(R = r \mid D, Q)
= 1 - P(R = \bar{r} \mid, D, Q)
\approxeq \log{ \frac{P(D \mid Q, R = r)}{P(D \mid Q, R = \bar{r})} }
$$

In a classical probabilistic model, the document is represented by a collection of its attributes $D = W_i, \dots, W_n$ (e.g. words) and the probabilities are factorised across these attributes - estimated from the set of relevant and non-relevant documents (e.g. MLE):

$$P(D \mid Q, R) = \prod_{i=1}^n{ P(W_i \mid Q, R) }$$

A language retrieval model ranks a document $D$ according to the probability that the document generates the query, i.e. $P(Q \mid D)$ where $C$ is the document collection and $\lambda$ is the Jelinek-Mercer smoothing parameter:

$$P(q_1, \dots, q_m \mid D ) = \prod_{i=1}^m{ \big( \lambda P_{MLE}(q_i \mid D) + (1-\lambda) P_{MLE}(q_i \mid C) \big) }$$

Evidence from multiple sources can easily be combined (with $cq_i$ = conceptual term, $w_l$ = content pattern such as a word image pattern):

$$P(cq_1, \dots, cq_m \mid D) = \prod_{i=1}^m{ \big( \alpha \sum_{i=1}^k{P(cq_i \mid w_l)P(w_l \mid D)} + \beta P(cq_i \mid D) + (1-\alpha-\beta) P(cq_i \mid C) \big) }$$

#### Inference Network Models

Representation as Bayesian Networks.

| Advantages                                                                                           | Disadvantages                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Elegantly combines multiple sources of evidence and probabilistic dependencies                       | Computationally not scalable for querying large collections |
| Easy integration of representations of different media, domain knowledge, semantic information, etc. |                                                             |
| Good retrieval performance                                                                           |                                                             |

## 3. Probabilistic Representations

_Topic modelling_: Unsupervised representation learning of latent topics.

_Realisational chain_: Ideas â†’ broad conceptual components of a text â†’ sub-ideas â†’
sentences â†’ set of semantic roles â†’ set of grammatical and
lexical concepts â†’ character sequences

**Generative model for documents**:

- Select a document $d_j$ with probability $P(d_j)$.
- Pick a latent class / concept $z_k$ with probability $P(d_j)$.
- Generate a word $w_i$ with probability $P(w_i \mid z_k)$.

Trained on a large corpus, learn:

- Per-document topic distributions.
- Per-topic word distributions.

### [Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/latent-semantic-analysis/)

Weakness: cannot capture polysemy. Probabilistic topic models are a solution to this.

### Probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA)

Maximum likelihood: parameters that maximise the likelihood of the observed data. Exact likelihood is intractable, we have to _approximate_ it, e.g., by:

- Expectation-maximization: iteratively estimate the probability of unobserved, latent variables until convergence.
- Gibbs sampling: update parameters sample-wise.
- Variational inference: approximate the model by an easier one.

These models are _unsupervised_ and learn from _raw_ data!

- Per-document topic distributions: $P(w_i \mid z_k)$.
- Per-topic word distributions: $P(z_k \mid d_j)$.

EM: TODO.

### Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)

Gibbs sampling:
